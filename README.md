# 🌦️📰 Simple API Integration Web App

A tiny vanilla JavaScript project that fetches **weather data** (OpenWeather), **news headlines** (GNewsAPI) and **riddles** (API Ninja) from APIs.  
Built with no frameworks — just **HTML, CSS, and JS modules**. The app is responsive ie ready to use across multiple devices, includes a **hamburger menu** for navigation in small screens, pagination for news response and shows **loading spinners** during API calls.

- **Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)** → Get current weather by user’s location or by city input.
- **News API (GNewsAPI.io)** → Search news articles by query and filter.
- **Riddle API (API Ninja.com)** → Get random riddles with revelable answers.
